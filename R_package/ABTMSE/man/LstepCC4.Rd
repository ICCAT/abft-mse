\title{A length based management procedure that incrementally changes TAC based on recent and long-term length observations (a management procedure of class MP).}
\usage{
LstepCC4(
  x,
  dset,
  yrsmth = 5,
  xx = 0.3,
  stepsz = 0.05,
  llim = c(0.96, 0.98, 1.05)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a simulation number.}

\item{dset}{a list of simulated data for use by management procedures.}

\item{yrsmth}{the number of years over which to compare length observations}

\item{xx}{alters target catch as a fraction of historical catch TACstar = (1-xx)muC}

\item{stepsz}{the maximum fractional change in TAC between MP updates}

\item{llim}{a vector of three ratios that determine whether the TAC should be reduced by 2 steps, 1 steps and increased by 1 step}
}
\value{
a TAC recommendation arising from \code{x, dset}.
}
