\title{A Southern Bluefin Tuna management procedure that uses recruitment trajectory to adjust TAC (a management procedure of class MP).}
\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a simulation number.}

\item{dset}{a list of simulated data for use by management procedures.}

\item{epsB}{currently unused}

\item{epsR}{resposiveness of the MP to recruitment gradient}

\item{tauR}{the time lag (years) for evaluating trend in recruitment}

\item{tauB}{currently unused}

\item{gamma}{currently unused}
}
\value{
a TAC recommendation arising from \code{x, dset, epsB, epsR, tauR, tauB, gamma}.
