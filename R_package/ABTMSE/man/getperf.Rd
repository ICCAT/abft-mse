\title{Calculate performance metrics.}
\usage{
getperf(MSE, rnd = 3, outdir = NA, quantiles = c(0.05, 0.95), quantile = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{MSE}{an object of class MSE}

\item{rnd}{number of significant digits to round tabulated values}

\item{outdir}{a directory for the table}

\item{quantiles}{a vector 2 long of upper and lower quantiles to calculate and include in the table if quantile=T}

\item{quantile}{logical: should quantiles be calculated and included in the table}
}
\value{
a list n stocks long each with a data frame of performance metrics (columns) by management procedure (row) \code{MSE}.
\itemize{
  \item C10. Mean yield over the first 10 years of the projection
  \item C20. Mean yield over years 11-20 of the projection
  \item C30. Mean yield over years 21-30 of the projection
  \item PGK. Probability of Green Kobe (F<FMSY AND B>BMSY) region over all years of the projection
  \item POF. Probability of Over-Fishing (F>FMSY) over all years of the projection
  \item POS. Probability of Over-Fished status (B<BMSY) over all years of the projection
  \item D10. Mean depletion (SSB relative to unfished) after 10 years of the projection
  \item D20. Mean depletion (SSB relative to unfished) after 20 years of the projection
  \item D30. Mean depletion (SSB relative to unfished) after 30 years of the projection
  \item LD. Mean spawning stock depletion over all projected years
  \item DNC Spawning stock Depletion in final projection year relative to zero fishing
  \item LDNC. Lowest Spawning Stock depletion over all projection years relative to zero fishing
  \item AAVY. Mean Average Annual Variability in Yield over all projections
