\title{An index-based (INDEX 4 - GOM_LAR_SUV) management procedure that incrementally changes TAC to achieve a stable index(a management procedure of class MP).}
\usage{
Islope1_i4(x, dset)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a simulation number.}

\item{dset}{a list of simulated data for use by management procedures.}

\item{yrsmth}{the number of years over which to compare index observations}

\item{xx}{alters target catch as a fraction of historical catch TACstar = (1-xx)muC}

\item{lambda}{a scalar which determines the responsiveness of the adjustment}
}
\value{
a TAC recommendation arising from \code{x, dset}.
