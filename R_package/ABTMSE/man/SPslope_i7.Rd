\title{A surplus production management procedure using INDEX 7 (JPN_LL_NEAtl2) that attempts to identify the slope of changes in surplus production and biomass to locate a gradient of zero (a management procedure of class MP).}
\usage{
SPslope_i7(x, dset)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a simulation number.}

\item{dset}{a list of simulated data for use by management procedures.}

\item{yrsmth}{the number of years over which to quantify slope in surplus production with biomass}

\item{alp}{the SP gradient limits that lead to TAC changes}

\item{bet}{the degree of responsiveness of the MP}
}
\value{
a TAC recommendation arising from \code{x, dset}.
}
