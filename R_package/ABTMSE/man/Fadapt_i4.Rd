\title{An adaptive surplus production management procedure using INDEX 4 (GOM_LAR_SUV) that attempts to identify the slope of changes in surplus production and biomass to locate a gradient of zero (a management procedure of class MP).}
\usage{
Fadapt_i4(x, dset)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a simulation number.}

\item{dset}{a list of simulated data for use by management procedures.}

\item{yrsmth}{the number of years over which to quantify slope in surplus production with biomass}

\item{gg}{the responsiveness of the MP with respect to the slope}

\item{FMSY_M}{the assumed ratio of FMSY to M}
}
\value{
a TAC recommendation arising from \code{x, dset}.
}
